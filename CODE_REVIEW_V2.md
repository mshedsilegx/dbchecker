# Code Review V2: Next-Level Improvements

This document provides a second-level review of the `dbchecker` utility, following the implementation of the critical security and robustness fixes from the first review. The codebase is now significantly more secure and reliable. This review focuses on production-readiness, maintainability, and best practices.

## 1. Executive Summary

The core functionality of the application is strong. The previous refactoring has addressed all major security and correctness issues. The next stage of improvements should focus on ensuring the long-term health and maintainability of the codebase.

**Key Recommendations:**
- **Critical: Introduce a Testing Suite.** The lack of automated tests is the single biggest remaining risk to the project.
- **Medium: Implement Configuration Validation.** Errors in the config file should be caught early with clear messages.
- **Low: Adopt Modern Go Practices.** Improvements in context propagation, versioning, and Oracle TLS support will bring the project in line with modern standards.

## 2. Detailed Recommendations

### 1. (Critical) Add a Testing Suite

The complete absence of automated tests (`_test.go` files) means that every change, no matter how small, requires manual testing to ensure it doesn't break existing functionality. This is inefficient and error-prone.

**Recommendation:**
Create a comprehensive test suite covering the following areas:
- **Unit Tests:** For pure functions like `crypto.Encrypt`/`crypto.Decrypt` and `database.buildTLSConfig`.
- **Integration Tests:** For the database drivers. These tests would require a running database instance (e.g., in a Docker container) to connect to. They should test the full `Connect`, `Ping`, `HealthCheck`, `Close` lifecycle for each supported database.

**Example: Unit Test for `buildTLSConfig`**
A new file `database/tls_test.go` could be created:
```go
package database

import (
	"testing"
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/require"
)

func TestBuildTLSConfig(t *testing.T) {
	t.Run("disable", func(t *testing.T) {
		cfg, err := buildTLSConfig("disable", "host")
		require.NoError(t, err)
		assert.Nil(t, cfg)
	})

	t.Run("require", func(t *testing.T) {
		cfg, err := buildTLSConfig("require", "host")
		require.NoError(t, err)
		require.NotNil(t, cfg)
		assert.True(t, cfg.InsecureSkipVerify)
	})

    // ... other cases ...
}
```

### 2. (Medium) Implement Configuration Validation

Currently, if a user provides an invalid `tls_mode` or database `type` in `config.yaml`, the error only occurs deep within the connection logic. Errors should be reported as early as possible.

**Recommendation:**
Add a `Validate()` method to the `Config` struct in `config/config.go` that is called immediately after `yaml.Unmarshal`. This method should iterate through the database configurations and check for invalid values.

**Example: `config/config.go`**
```go
var supportedDBTypes = map[string]struct{}{"mysql":{}, "postgres":{}, "oracle":{}, "sqlserver":{}, "sqlite":{}, "mongodb":{}}
var supportedTLSModes = map[string]struct{}{"disable":{}, "require":{}, "verify-ca":{}, "verify-full":{}, "":{}}

func (c *Config) Validate() error {
    for id, dbConfig := range c.Databases {
        if _, ok := supportedDBTypes[dbConfig.Type]; !ok {
            return fmt.Errorf("database %s has unsupported type: %s", id, dbConfig.Type)
        }
        if _, ok := supportedTLSModes[dbConfig.TLSMode]; !ok {
            return fmt.Errorf("database %s has unsupported tls_mode: %s", id, dbConfig.TLSMode)
        }
    }
    return nil
}
```
Then, in `main.go`:
```go
// ...
	if err = yaml.Unmarshal(data, &config); err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
    if err = config.Validate(); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
// ...
```

### 3. (Low) Improve Context Propagation

In `database/mongodb.go`, all driver calls use `context.TODO()`. This is a placeholder that should be replaced with a proper context, allowing for timeouts and cancellation.

**Recommendation:**
Create a root context in `main.go` and pass it down through the call chain (`checkDatabase` -> `db.Connect`, `db.Ping`, etc.). This would require modifying the `DB` interface to accept a `context.Context`.

**Example: `database/database.go` interface change**
```go
type DB interface {
	Connect(ctx context.Context, cfg config.DatabaseConfig, decryptedPassword string) error
	Ping(ctx context.Context) error
	HealthCheck(ctx context.Context, query string) error
	Close(ctx context.Context) error
}
```

### 4. (Low) Implement Build-time Versioning

The `version` variable in `main.go` is uninitialized. This is a common pattern for injecting the version at build time.

**Recommendation:**
Use Go's `-ldflags` during the build process to set the version.

**Example Build Command:**
```bash
go build -ldflags="-X main.version=1.1.0" .
```
The `README.md` should be updated with instructions on how to build the application this way.

### 5. (Low) Add Oracle Wallet Support

The Oracle driver's TLS verification (`verify-ca`, `verify-full`) is currently disabled because it requires a wallet, and there is no way to configure the wallet path.

**Recommendation:**
Add a `wallet_path: string` field to the `DatabaseConfig` struct in `config/config.go`. In `database/oracle.go`, if this path is provided, pass it as the `wallet` option in the connection string to enable full TLS verification.
